<h1>LDAP : (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)</h1>
LDAP {Lightweight Directory Access Protocol} is an open, vendor-neutral application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over a network. It acts as a standardized communication language that allows applications and users to find and verify information like usernames, passwords, and other user attributes stored in a central directory service. A directory service is essentially a network-based phonebook for resources like users, groups, and devices, and LDAP provides the mechanism to query, retrieve, and manage this data efficiently.
